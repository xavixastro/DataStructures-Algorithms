// Connected Components
// You are given a file which looks like so:

// AA BB
// DD FF
// CC EE
// EE DD
// Each line of the file contains a pair of strings.Each string represents is the 
// name of a vertex.The line represents an edge connecting two vertices.

// Your task is to find the connected components of the graph.A connected component 
// is a subset of vertices all connected to each other.In this example, the connected 
// components are[["AA", "BB"], ["CC", "DD", "EE", "FF"]].

// You don't have to return the elements of the components in any particular order.
