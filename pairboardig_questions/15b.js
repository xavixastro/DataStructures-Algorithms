// median
// Given two sorted arrays, find the median element amongst the two arrays.
// That is, if both arrays were combined, find the median element from the combined array.
// Assume that there is not enough memory to actually combine both arrays.
// There exists an O(log n + log m) solution.

// [1,3,3,6,7,8,9] median = 6
// [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9] median = 4.5 = (4 + 5) % 2
