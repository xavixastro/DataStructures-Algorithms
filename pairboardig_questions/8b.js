// StackQueue
// Implement a queue using stacks.That is, write enqueue and dequeue using only push and pop operations.

// In terms of performance, enqueue should be O(1), but dequeue may be worst -case O(n).
// In terms of ammortized time, dequeue should be O(1).Prove that your solution accomplishes this.
