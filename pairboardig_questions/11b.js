// cyclic ?
// Consider a linked list. Each link in the list holds a next reference to the 
// next item in the list, except for the final link, which points to nil.

// It is possible to have a "list" without any end, which loops back on itself.

// Possibilities:

// A -> B -> C -> A -> ...
// A -> B -> C -> B -> ...

// Write a method cyclic ? (first_link), which will return true if a list is cyclic.
// Your first version may use O(n) memory.Next, write a version which uses O(1) memory; 
// you'll probably need a different approach.
